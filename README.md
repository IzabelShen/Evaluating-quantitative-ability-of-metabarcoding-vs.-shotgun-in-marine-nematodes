# Evaluating Quantitative Performance of Metabarcoding and Shotgun Sequencing Using Marine Nematode Mock Communities

This repository contains data, scripts, and documentation for a study evaluating how well amplicon-based metabarcoding and shotgun metagenomic sequencing reflect true community composition in marine nematode assemblages. 

Mock communities were assembled using marine nematodes collected from soft sediment in the Baltic Ssea. The goal of this study is to assess the quantitative performance of two commonly used sequencing approaches: metabarcoding and shotgun metagenomic sequencing.
