# Evaluating quantitative ability of metabarcoding and shotgun using mock communities comprising marine nematodes 

A study about Mock communities comprising of nematoda from soft sediment of the Baltic Sea and are to compare how wwll the relative read proportion of nematoda derived from metabarcoding and shotgun sequencing data are in comparsion with the original proportion of species in the mock communities.
