# Evaluating Quantitative Performance of Metabarcoding and Shotgun Sequencing Using Marine Nematode Mock Communities

This repository contains data, analysis scripts, and documentation associated with a study evaluating how accurately amplicon-based metabarcoding and shotgun metagenomic sequencing reflect true community composition in marine nematode assemblages.

Mock communities were assembled from marine nematodes collected from soft-sediment habitats in the Baltic Sea. The primary objective of this study is to assess and compare the quantitative performance of two widely used sequencing approaches — metabarcoding and shotgun metagenomic sequencing — in terms of organism detection, taxonomic classification, and abundance estimation.
